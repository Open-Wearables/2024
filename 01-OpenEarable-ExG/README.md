## ðŸ“„ Abstract

While traditional earphones primarily offer private audio spaces, so-called "earables" emerged to offer a variety of sensing capabilities. Pioneering platforms like OpenEarable have introduced novel sensing platforms targeted at the ears, incorporating various sensors. The proximity of the ears to the eyes, brain, and facial muscles has also sparked investigation into sensing biopotentials. However, currently there is no platform available that is targeted at the ears to sense biopotentials. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEarable ExG â€” an open-source hardware platform designed to measure biopotentials in and around the ears. OpenEarable ExG can be freely configured and has up to 7 sensing channels. We initially validate OpenEarable ExG in a study with a left-right in-ear dual-electrode montage setup with 3 participants. Our results demonstrate the successful detection of smooth pursuit eye movements via Electrooculography (EOG), alpha brain activity via Electroencephalography (EEG), and jaw clenching via Electromyography (EMG). OpenEarable ExG is part of the OpenEarable initiative and is fully open-source under MIT license.
