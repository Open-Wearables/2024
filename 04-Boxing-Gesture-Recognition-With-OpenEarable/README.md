## ðŸ“„ Abstract
Earables, wearable devices worn around the ear, offer new possibilities for sports applications requiring precise head movement analysis, such as boxing. However, boxing-specific gesture recognition using IMU sensors integrated into earables remains underexplored. This work addresses this gap by investigating the potential of the open-source OpenEarable platform for real-time recognition of defensive boxing manoeuvres, including slipping, rolling and pulling back. We propose an extension to OpenEarable, integrating a Python server that leverages machine learning and dynamic time warping for gesture recognition. Furthermore, the web dashboard is enhanced to enable server communication and implement a gesture mirroring feature, providing real-time visual feedback. Real-time testing achieved a high accuracy of 96%, with feedback delivered within one second. All the system components are made available in a GitHub repository.
