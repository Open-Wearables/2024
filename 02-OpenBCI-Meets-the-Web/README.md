## ðŸ“„ Abstract

The traditional process of EEG-based BCI data collection is cumbersome and expertise-dependent due to complex hardware instrumentation, but also because data collection software typically comes as an on-premise solution with features tailored to trained experimenters. To overcome these limitations, we herein present a customizable platform for EEG data collection using OpenBCI hardware, that simplifies and accelerates the EEG setup process. The proposed system integrates various adaptations of the OpenBCI recording hardware, enabling easy customizability for versatile electrode configurations. The frontend, developed with Vue 3 and D3.js, provides real-time impedance checks and data visualization, while the backend, utilizing Apache, Node.js, and Flask, ensures efficient data transmission and storage. This platform addresses critical needs for cross-platform compatibility, customizability, efficient session management, and user-friendly interfaces, making it ideal for large-scale and field studies. The automated data management and real-time feedback enhance data quality and reliability, supporting various research applications.
